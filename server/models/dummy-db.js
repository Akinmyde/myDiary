  story: 'For so long, I wished for the day. The day that our love would find its way. From my heart and into your soul, The feeling so strong, I had no control. When then that day came, when I found you again, I vowed never to make the same mistake. I knew I would never let you go, For my life is now complete in a way I cannot show. For eternity I will spend making you believe, You are the sole reason that I breathe. My life is yours, my hopes and desires too. Until my dying day, my heart is reserved just for you. You are everything I could ever need and more, More than I deserve or would dare wish for. You are my baby, my angel, my dream girl I\'m thankful every day that you are my whole world. For the time I spend with you, my heart truly sings My one, My only, My EVERYTHING.'
